This project showcases a report provided to a hypothetical HR executive, who was preparing for an offsite and wanted to understand whether efficiency of the recruiting process was related to acceptance rates of offers. Additionally, the HR executive wanted to see how types of candidates were progressing through the recruiting process and any notable differences over the past few years. Finally, the HR executive wanted some recommendations related to the upcoming recruiting season for engineers based upon the findings. This report is similar in style to the kinds of reports I provide executive leaders in my current role as a Senior Research Scientist. 

I provided a pdf report for the executive, which can be viewed below.
